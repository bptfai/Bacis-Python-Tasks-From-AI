# Bacis-Python-Tasks-From-AI
Within this repository, there are tasks for you to solve in order to improve your Python skills. The tasks are taken from artificial intelligence sources, but the solutions are mine. You can seek help from these solutions and develop them. Have a nice coding !

Note: I have used terminal colors in these solutions. But unfortunately, only Unix systems can support this attribute. If you want you can write color attribute for windows systems with external modules.

# Task 1
Palindrom: a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. (Example: 123321, -7887, 0 is palindromic. 12 is not palindromic.)
Check number if is palindrome or not. Do not interact with floats and strings.
# Task2
Find the percentages of characters used in the text. (Example: 1234 --> 1:%25, 2:%25, 3:%25, 4:%25)
Interact with all data types.
