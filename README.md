# Bacis-Python-Tasks-From-AI
There are many daily python3 tasks from AI in this repo. You can solve them and develop yourself !

# Task 1
Check number if is palindrome or not.
(Note: I have used terminal colors in this file. But unfortunately only Unix systems can support this attribute. If you want you can write color attribute for windows systems with external modules.)
Have a good coding !
